# Data Encryption Standard
This is my version of DES implemented from https://crypto-textbook.com/download/Understanding_Cryptography_Chptr_3---DES.pdf
This version should stress readability first and foremost, with optimizations
coming at a later time.

## TODO:
- Separate into different files
- Use C registers for speedhttps://www.c-programming-simple-steps.com/c-register.html
- Replace row indexing with bitwise shifts
